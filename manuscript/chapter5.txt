-# Reading Data Advanced



## Index

Quickly you will realize that `filter` is slow. If you have a table
with more than 100,000 records, `filter` stops working. All of that is becuase
we haven't used index yet. Without index, we cannot even order data

    r.db("foodb").table("compounds_foods").orderBy(r.desc("id"))
    #->
    RqlRuntimeError: Array over size limit `100000` in:
    r.db("foodb").table("compounds_foods").orderBy(r.desc("id"))
    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Without an index, RethinkDB hold all data in memory and sort or filter in
memory. A limit has to lie somewhere else. That 100,000 the magic number of the limit
RethinkDB set to read data without index.


To properpely fetching data, we have to create an Index. And really, in real application, we almost always endup creating index on MySQL  to fetch data efficiently. 

We have two kind of indexes in RethinkDB

* primary index: our ID key is this. This index is created automatically by
RethinkDB. Coming back above query, if we change it to use primary `index`

    r.db("foodb").table("compounds_foods").orderBy({index: r.desc("id")})

`id` field is always indexed automatically.

* secondary index:

Seconday index is the index we created ourselve on one or many fields. Secondary
index can be simple, just index the value of fields directly, or doing some
pre-calculate on data before indexing.

While index helps to decrease the reading time, it decreases writing time, also cost
storage space. It reduces write performance becuase whenever we inserted a
document, the index has to be calculate and writing into the database.

RethinkDB supports those kinds of index:

*Simple
:indexes based on the value of a single field.
*Compound
:indexes based on multiple fields.
*Multi 
:indexes based on arrays of values.
*Indexes 
:based on arbitrary expressions.

So now you know what index is. But a sad news is that filter cannot use those secondary index. FOr that purpose we have to use other functions: `getAll` and `between`. 
### Creating index

#### Simple index

As its name, simple index is simply a single field. Let's say we want to find all `compounds_foods` whose name contains `banana`. Note that 

    table.index_create(index_name[, index_function][, :multi => false]) â†’ object

    r.db('db').table(table).indexCreate(indexName)

This work when we want to find data based on a single field. How about find all 

For a multi index on arrays of values. Because of the value is an array, it has
many value which needed to be index multiple times.



RqlRuntimeError: Index `status` on table `phim365.epqueue` was accessed before its construction was finished in:
r.db("phim365").table("epqueue").getAll("ready", {index: "status"}).limit(1)

### Checking index status

As I said above, indexing reduces write performance, therefore it takes time to
create after we issue creating command. Depend on the table size, how many
records we have, we have to wait for an amout of time before using it. We can
check the status of index creating

    r.table().indexStatus

Or if we can tell RethinkDB to do something after indexing finishs:

  r.table.indexWait


### Drop index
    
When we change data structure, we may want to drop the index. It's easy.

    r.table().indexDrop(index_name)

### Using index




## Order

Sorting with order without index limit to 100k issue

## Pagination

To pagination data, we will use a a combination of `skip`, `limit` and `slice`.

**skip(n)**

: Skip a number of element from the begining of sequence or array

**limit(n)**

: End the sequence after we read up to the give number of limit

**slice
