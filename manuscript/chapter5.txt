-# Reading Data Advanced

## Index

Quickly you will realize that `filter` is slow. If you have a table
with more than 100,000 records, `filter` stops working. All of that is becuase
we haven't used index yet. Without index, we cannot even order data

    r.db("foodb").table("compounds_foods").orderBy(r.desc("id"))
    #->
    RqlRuntimeError: Array over size limit `100000` in:
    r.db("foodb").table("compounds_foods").orderBy(r.desc("id"))
    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Without an index, RethinkDB hold all data in memory and sort or filter in
memory. A limit has to lie somewhere else. That 100,000 the magic number of the limit
RethinkDB set to read data without index.


To properpely fetching data, we have to create an Index. And really, in real application, we almost always endup creating index on MySQL  to fetch data efficiently. 

We have two kind of indexes in RethinkDB

* primary index: our ID key is this. This index is created automatically by
RethinkDB. Coming back above query, if we change it to use primary `index`

    r.db("foodb").table("compounds_foods").orderBy({index: r.desc("id")})

`id` field is always indexed automatically.

* secondary index:

Seconday index is the index we created ourselve on one or many fields. Secondary
index can be simple, just index the value of fields directly, or doing some
pre-calculate on data before indexing.

While index helps to decrease the reading time, it decreases writing time, also cost
storage space. It reduces write performance becuase whenever we inserted a
document, the index has to be calculate and writing into the database.

RethinkDB supports those kinds of index:

*Simple
:indexes based on the value of a single field.
*Compound
:indexes based on multiple fields.
*Multi 
:indexes based on arrays of values.
*Indexes 
:based on arbitrary expressions.

So now you know what index is. But a sad news is that filter cannot use those secondary index. FOr that purpose we have to use other functions: `getAll` and `between`. 
### Creating index

Let's start with simple index first.

#### Simple index

As its name, simple index is simply a single field. Let's say we want to find all `compounds_foods` whose name contains `banana`. We cannot use `filter` here because this table has more than 100,000 item. `filter` also doesn't use index. Let's meet `getAll`. `getAll` grabs all document where a given key match the index which we specified.

First, we create index follow this syntax

    table.index_create(index_name[, index_function][, :multi => false]) → object

Apply it on our case, for a single column:

    r.db("foodb")
      .table("compounds_foods")
      .indexCreate("match_orig_food_common_name", r.row.match)

If we don't pass an index function, RethinkDB try to create index for the column of same name as requested index name.

Time to use it:

    r.db("foodb")
      .table("compounds_foods")
      .getAll('Bananas', {index:'orig_food_common_name'})
    #=> Executed in 10ms. No results returned.

No result. Strange, we cannot believe we have no document where its
orig_food_common_name doesn't contain banana. Why so? Well, the simple
index does an exact match, or in other world, it's an equal comparison.
Let's try an exact match:

    r.db("foodb")
      .table("compounds_foods")
      .getAll('Bananas, raw', {index:'orig_food_common_name'})
    #=> Executed in 69ms. 40 rows returned, 40 displayed, more available
    {
    "citation":  "USDA" ,
    "citation_type":  "DATABASE" ,
    "compound_id": 2100 ,
    "created_at": Tue Jan 03 2012 18:33:15 GMT-08:00 ,
    "creator_id": null ,
    "food_id": 208 ,
    "id": 257686 ,
    "orig_citation": null ,
    "orig_compound_id":  "262" ,
    "orig_compound_name":  "Caffeine" ,
    "orig_content":  "0.0" ,
    "orig_food_common_name":  "Bananas, raw" ,
    "orig_food_id":  "09040" ,
    "orig_food_part": null ,
    "orig_food_scientific_name": null ,
    "orig_max": null ,
    "orig_method": null ,
    "orig_min": null ,
    "orig_unit":  "mg" ,
    "orig_unit_expression": null ,
    "updated_at": Tue Jan 03 2012 18:33:15 GMT-08:00 ,
    "updater_id": null
    }

We can pass multiple keys to `getAll` to have an `or` effect. Meaning RethinkDB
returns document where the index match any of value that we pass.

    r.db("foodb")
      .table("compounds_foods")
      .getAll('Bananas, raw', 'Yoghurt with pear and banana', 'Alfalfa seeds',{index:'orig_food_common_name'})

We can chain to `count` to count how many document we have

    r.db("foodb")
      .table("compounds_foods")
      .getAll('Bananas, raw', 'Yoghurt with pear and banana', 'Alfalfa seeds',{index:'orig_food_common_name'})
      .count()
    #=> 256

Not only use to find document, index can be used for sorting as well. To sort,
we call `orderBy` and passing index name.

    r.db("foodb").table("compounds_foods")
      .orderBy({index: "orig_food_common_name"})

When passing index, we can wrap it in other expression to change ordering:

    r.db("foodb").table("compounds_foods")
      .orderBy({index: r.desc("orig_food_common_name")})
      .withFields("orig_food_common_name")
    #=> 
    {
    "orig_food_common_name":  "Zwieback"
    } {
    "orig_food_common_name":  "Zwieback"
    } {
    "orig_food_common_name":  "Zwieback"
    }

Using `withFields`, we can pass a list of field to choose what we want to get
back.

Because index can be used to sort, we can use it to find the value between a
range. In RethinkDB, `between` syntax is:

    table.between(lowerKey, upperKey[, {index: 'id', leftBound: 'closed',
rightBound: 'open'}]) → selection

As you see, we can only use between on table type. So, note that.
Use this we can find the document between "Apple" and "Banana" range.

    r.db("foodb").table("compounds_foods")
      .between("Apple", "Banana", {index: 'orig_food_common_name'})
      .orderBy({index: r.desc("orig_food_common_name")})
      .withFields("orig_food_common_name")

Without specifying an index, `between` operates on primary index. Many RethinkDB 
function has same behaviour

    r.db("foodb").table("compounds_foods")
      .between(1, 200)
      .count()
    #=> 198

This work when we want to find data based on a single field. How about find
value base on multiple field. Let's meet compound index

##### Compound index

Compound index is created by using value of multiple fields. It's very similar to
single index in syntax, just different on how many fields we pass to index
create. Let's look at `compounds_foods` table, it contains relation ship of
`foods` and `compounds`. We will learn more about JOIN later. For now, let's say
we want to find all `compounds_foods` document where its `compound_id` is 3524
and `food_id` is 287. We are finding on two columnds, so we need an index
contains those 2 columns:

    r.db("foodb").table("compounds_foods")
      .indexCreate("compound_food_id", [r.row(row"compound_id"), r.row("food_id")]) 

The only different with simple index is we have to pass an array of field to
create index. Let's try it:

    r.db("foodb").table("compounds_foods")
      .getAll([354,287], {index: 'compound_food_id'})
    #=>
    RqlRuntimeError: Index `compound_food_id` on table `foodb.compounds_foods` was
    accessed before its construction was finished in:
    r.db("foodb").table("compounds_foods").getAll([354, 287], {index:
    "compound_food_id"})
    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We got an error. Looks like the index is not completed created yet. The table
has 

We can query index status:

    r.db("foodb").table("compounds_foods")
      .indexStatus('compound_food_id')
    #=>
    [
    {
    "blocks_processed": 13192 ,
    "blocks_total": 15437 ,
    "function": <binary, 408 bytes, "24 72 65 71 6c 5f..."> ,
    "geo": false ,
    "index":  "compound_food_id" ,
    "multi": false ,
    "outdated": false ,
    "ready": false
    }
    ]

The field ready is false. We can only wait until it finish. This table is very
big. We can verify:

    r.db("foodb").table("compounds_foods").count()
    #=> 737089

Let's just wait for bit, make a cup of coffee and come back :). When it's ready
you should see:

    r.db("foodb").table("compounds_foods")
      .indexStatus('compound_food_id')

    [
    {
    "function": <binary, 408 bytes, "24 72 65 71 6c 5f..."> ,
    "geo": false ,
    "index":  "compound_food_id" ,
    "multi": false ,
    "outdated": false ,
    "ready": true
    }
    ]

Now, try it:
    
    r.db("foodb").table("compounds_foods")
      .getAll([21477,899], {index: 'compound_food_id'})
    #=> Executed in 7ms. 1 row returned
    {
    "citation":  "DFC CODES" ,
    "citation_type":  "DATABASE" ,
    "compound_id": 21477 ,
    "created_at": Tue Sep 11 2012 16:12:30 GMT-07:00 ,
    "creator_id": null ,
    "food_id": 899 ,
    "id": 740574 ,
    "orig_citation": null ,
    "orig_compound_id": null ,
    "orig_compound_name": null ,
    "orig_content": null ,
    "orig_food_common_name":  "Meats" ,
    "orig_food_id":  "WI8000" ,
    "orig_food_part": null ,
    "orig_food_scientific_name": null ,
    "orig_max": null ,
    "orig_method": null ,
    "orig_min": null ,
    "orig_unit": null ,
    "orig_unit_expression": null ,
    "updated_at": Tue Sep 11 2012 16:12:30 GMT-07:00 ,
    "updater_id": null
    }

### Checking index status

As I said above, indexing reduces write performance, therefore it takes time to
create after we issue creating command. Depend on the table size, how many
records we have, we have to wait for an amout of time before using it. We can
check the status of index creating

    r.table().indexStatus

Or if we can tell RethinkDB to do something after indexing finishs:

  r.table.indexWait


### Drop index
    
When we change data structure, we may want to drop the index. It's easy.

    r.table().indexDrop(index_name)

### Using index


## Order

Sorting with order without index limit to 100k issue

## Pagination

To pagination data, we will use a a combination of `skip`, `limit` and `slice`.

**skip(n)**

: Skip a number of element from the begining of sequence or array

**limit(n)**

: End the sequence after we read up to the give number of limit

**slice

T> ## Where else I can call Skip, Limit, Slice
T>
T> These command can be called on a selection, an array or stream. So you ca
