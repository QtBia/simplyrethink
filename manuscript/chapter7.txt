# JOIN

Join is a joy to work with. Without joy, we have to either embed or joinging
data with our code instead of database take care of that for us. In RethinkDB,
`JOIN` are automatically distributed, meaning if you run on a cluster, the data
will be combined from many clusters and presents final result to you.
