-#Getting to know RethinkDB

# Getting Started

It's not uncommon to see someone write a interactive shell in browser for
evaluation purpose such as mongly, tryRedis. This isn't apply for RethinkDB
because it comes with a excellent editor where you can type code and run it.

Install RethinkDB by downloading package for your platform http://rethinkdb.com/docs/install/. Run it after installing.


## Ports

By default, RethinkDB runs on 3 ports

8080
: this is the web user interface of RethinkDB, or the dashboard. You can query
the data, check performance, server status

28015
: this is the client drive port. All client drive will connect to RethinkDB
through this port. 

29015
: this is intracluster port. Different RethinkDB node in a cluster communicates
with eath others via this port

## Get to know the dashboard

Open your browser at http://127.0.0.1:8080 and welcome RethinkDB. You can play
around to see what you have:

Navigate to the Explrer tab, you can type the command from there. Let's start
with 

    r.dbList()

Run it, and you can see a list of database.


# RethinkDB object

Just similar to traditonal database system, we have database in RethinkDB. A
database contains many tables. Each table contains your JSON document. Those
JSON document can contains any fields. A table doesn't force a schema for those
fields. 

A JSON document is similar to a row in MySQL. Each of field in the document is
similar to column in MySQL.

# Durability

You will see a option/argument call `durability`
`*durability` will appear a lot in many option of ReQL db. Because it's so
common and it's very important, I want to address it here. durability accepts 
value of *'soft'* or *'hard'*. 

soft
: means the writes will be acknowledge by server immdediately and data will be flushed to disk in
background. If you write a large chunk of data. 

hard
: The opposite of soft, the default behaviour is to acknowledge after data is written to disk.
Therefore, it will be longer. When you don't need the data consitent, such as
writing a cache, or an important log, you should set durability to soft to
increase speed

# Command line tool

We have two way to interact with RethinkDB: either using the command line or use
the administrator dashboard. Eg,
Besides the dashboard, RethinkDB gives us some command line utility to
interactive with it. However, we will focus into those at this moment:

* import
* export
* dump
* restore

## import

In the spirit of giving user the dashboard, RethinkDB also gives us sample data.
You can download the data in file input_polls and country_stats at []https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/tree/next/demos/election and import them into
test database

~~~~~~~~
rethinkdb import -c localhost:28015 --table test.input_polls --pkey uuid -f input_polls.json --format json
rethinkdb import -c localhost:28015 --table test.county_stats --pkey uuid -f county_stats.json --format json
~~~~~~~~

Notice the `--table` argument, we are passing the table name in format of
*database_name*.*table_name". In our case, we import the data into two tables:
`input_polls` and `county_stats` inside database `test`.

We will use those data set throught the book. At any point, if you messed up the
data, just drop the table, and import again.

## export

## dump

dump will just export whole of data of a cluster. Its syntax
    
    rethinkdb dump -c HOST:PORT

## restore

Once we got the dump file with `dump` command. We can restore with:

    rethinkdb restore -c HOST:PORT rethinkdb_dump_DATE_TIME.tar.gz
