# Getting Started

It's not uncommon to see someone write a interactive shell in browser for
evaluation purpose such as mongly, tryRedis. This isn't apply for RethinkDB
because it comes with a excellent editor where you can type code and run it.

Install RethinkDB by downloading package for your platform http://rethinkdb.com/docs/install/
Open your browser at http://127.0.0.1:8080 and welcome RethinkDB

Then download the sample datasheet 

Then import it with:

rethinkdb restore
