# Getting Started

It's not uncommon to see someone write a interactive shell in browser for
evaluation purpose such as mongly, tryRedis. This isn't apply for RethinkDB
because it comes with a excellent editor where you can type code and run it.

Install RethinkDB by downloading package for your platform http://rethinkdb.com/docs/install/. Run it after installing.

Open your browser at http://127.0.0.1:8080 and welcome RethinkDB. You can play
around to see what you have:

Navigate to the Explrer tab, you can type the command from there. Let's start
with 

```
r.dbList()
```

Run it, and you can see a list of database.


## RethinkDB object

Just similar to traditonal database system, we have database in RethinkDB. A
database contains many tables. Each table contains your JSON document. Those
JSON document can contains any fields. A table doesn't force a schema for those
fields. 

A JSON document is similar to a row in MySQL. Each of field in the document is
similar to column in MySQL.


## Command line tool

Besides the dashboard, RethinkDB gives us some command line utility to
interactive with it. However, we will focus into those at this moment:

* import
* export
* dump
* restore

### dump utility

### import

## Settign up sample data

Download the data in input_polls and country_stats from and import them into
test database with.

```
rethinkdb import -c localhost:28015 --table test.input_polls --pkey uuid -f input_polls.json --format json
rethinkdb import -c localhost:28015 --table test.county_stats --pkey uuid -f county_stats.json --format json
```
