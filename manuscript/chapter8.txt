-# TIME

RethinkDB supports date time date with millisecond precison times with timezon.
It is integrated with the drivers. Meaning you will work with the time data in
your language. You don't have to convert it to a special format. Such as in 
JavaScript you can just insert a document like

  r.table('input_polls').insert({
    timestamp: 
  })

or in Ruby

  r.table('events').insert(
    {'id' => 0, 'timestamp' => Time.now}
  )

When you reading back the time, again, it's converted into a native time
object/data type of your language. This save you bunch of time from dealing with
time formating, timezone.

## Timezone

When you are setting a native time object to a RethinkDB document, if the object
includes a timezone value, RethinkDB picks up it and use it, otherwise, it
defaults to UTC time. 

## RethinkDB time command

What if we want to use expression and want to access time from inside ReQL.
RethinkDB supports a couple of command

### now

    r.now()
    //=>
    Tue Aug 19 2014 08:00:38 GMT+00:00

Notice the return time is in GMT+00, it's same as UTC.

### epochTime

 
    
# WRAP UP
