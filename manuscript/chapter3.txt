# Getting to Know ReQL

RethinkDB uses a special syntax call ReQL to interactive with the data. ReQL is
chainable. You start with a table, and chain to other API to get what you want,
in a way very natural. Eg.

```
r.db("test").table('movie').filter({'type': 'anime'})
```

Don't worry about the syntax, just look at it again and even without any
knowledge you know what it does and easily remember it.
