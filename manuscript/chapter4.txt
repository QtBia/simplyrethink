# Writing data

## Manipulation database: create, delete, list

These are very simple. Probably with example you get it instanly

    //Create database
    r.dbCreate("db1")
    #=>
    {
      "created": 1
    }

If creating succesfully, we get back the object with `created` is *1*. We can
confirm by listing what we have:

    r.dbList()
    #=>
    [
    "test" ,
    "db1"
    ]

So we got the default test and db1 is what we just have. Since we don't use db1,
let delete it to keep it clean. 

    r.dbDrop('db1')

    

As you can guess now, we will start from the database, chain the table, and use
`*insert*` method to insert a document into the table. Eg

    r.db('test').table('input_polls').insert({
      id: 'foo',
      Day: 120,
      Date: 'May 2',
      Dem: '49'
    })
    
    #=>
    {
      "deleted": 0 ,
      "errors": 0 ,
      "generated_keys": [
      "13556cd8-034c-4c0e-91c0-666230740121"
      ] ,
      "inserted": 1 ,
      "replaced": 0 ,
      "skipped": 0 ,
      "unchanged": 0
    }

The return object contains following attributes. 

inserted
: the number of documents that were succesfully inserted.

replaced
: the number of documents that were updated when upsert is used.

unchanged
: the number of documents that would have been modified, except that the new value was the same as the old value when doing an upsert.

errors
: the number of errors encountered while performing the insert.

first_error
: If errors were encountered, contains the text of the first error.

deleted, skipped
: 0 for an insert operation.

generated_keys
: a list of generated primary keys in case the primary keys for some documents were missing (capped to 100000).

warnings
: if the field generated_keys is truncated, you will get the warning "Too many generated keys (<X>), array truncated to 100000.".
old_val
: if returnVals is set to true, contains null.
new_val
: if returnVals is set to true, contains the inserted/updated document.

Notice the generated_keys. If you insert a document without set a value for
primary key, whose field name is `*id*` by default, RethinkDB will generate an
UUID[^uuid] for it and return here.

[^uuid]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier

With our example, we can retreive back the document again.

    r.table('input_polls').get('13556cd8-034c-4c0e-91c0-666230740121')
    #=>
    {
        "Date":  "May 2" ,
        "Day": 120 ,
        "Dem":  "49" ,
        "id":  "foo" ,
        "uuid":  "13556cd8-034c-4c0e-91c0-666230740121"
    }

Notice the `*uuid*` field? Our table has primary field is `*uuid*` and its value
is set automatically by RethinkDB. 


### Delete

To remove one ore more document, just use ReQL to select what we want and
execute `*delete*` on them.
