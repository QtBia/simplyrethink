# Introduction

Welcome the readers. I appreciate your purchase. This will help me continue
improving the book content.

Before we go into the technical detail, I have something to say.

Firsly, I'm not a RethinkDB expert at all. I'm just the average guy who love
programming and new technolgy. To me, RethinkDB is very joyful to use.
However, due to its age, it doesn't have many book, document comparing to other
database system. RethinkDB Doc/API document is very good. However, at the entry
level, it can be hard to understand how to use an API or where to start, I cannot
just jump direcly into API document and use it.

This books try to organize the concept of RethinkDB, hopefully make you able to 
read and understand RethinkDB API directly. At the end of the book, you can quite 
easily extend your knowledge by browsering more RethinkDB document.

If I do my job well, this book is what I wish I had read when I started with 
RethinkDB instead of spending hours on API docs then trying and fail in console.

Secondly, I'm a fan of Mixu's[^mixu] writing style[^mixu_write]. I won't cover
deeply stuff like installing RethinkDB, and so on. Those topics are covered 
very good on RethinkDB document itself. I also won't cover extensively
parameter, option of command. Indeed, you can easily look up for a particular 
API and find all its argument, option. I will just make sure you understand what
is the command, what it does do, and how to apply it in a real scenario.

Thirdly, I'm not fluent in English. If you found any mistake, you can report in
issue on [repository](https://github.com/kureikain/simplyrethink) or email me.

Forthly, RethinkDB is changing so fast that something in this book may not reflect
to the current state. Bear with it and let me know, via my email or Github. Since this is a LeanPub
book, once I updated you can download it again free of charge.

And finally, due to my limited knowledge with RethinkDB (again, I'm nowhere a
RethinkDB expert), I want to keep this book short and to the point. Expect around 100
pages. A book that you can pick up and read on the train when riding to work, and after
a week you can sitdown and start the first RethinkDB power project.

# Why RethinkDB

RethinkDB is a mind blowing to me. I like the beauty, nature of ReQL which is
built into your language. It's also very developer friendly with its own
administrator UI. RethinkDB is very easy to learn, because its query language is
nature to what we think. We can easily tell what a ReQL do, what is the
execution order.

Take this SQL query:

    SELECT * FROM tables ORDER BY id DESC LIMIT 10,100

Compare with RQL:

    r.table(tables).order_by(r.desc(id)).limit(10)

We can guess what it does from query, and the order of execution is clear too
us.
