# Introduction

Welcome the readers. I appreciate your purchase. This will help me continue
improving the book content.

Before we go into the technical detail, I have something to say.

Firsly, I'm not a RethinkDB expert at all. I'm just the average guy who love
programming and new technolgy. To me, RethinkDB is just so good to pick up.
However, due to its age, it doesn't have many book, document comparing to other
database system. RethinkDB Doc/API document is very good. However, at the entry
level, it can be hard to understand how to use an API. Where to start, I cannot
just jump direcly into API document and use it.
This books try to organize the concept of RethinkDB, make you able to read and 
understand RethinkDB API directly. At the end of the book, you can quite easily
extend your knowledge by browsering more RethinkDB document.

If I do my job well, this book is what I wish I had read when I started with 
RethinkDB instead of spending hours on Google, StackOverflow.

Secondly, I'm a fan of Mixu's[^mixu] writing style[^mixu_write]. I won't cover
deeply stuff like installing RethinkDB, and so on. Those topics are covered 
very good on RethinkDB document itself. I also won't cover extensively
parameter, option of command. Indeed, you can easily look up for a particular 
API and find all its argument, option. I will just make sure you understand what
is the command do, and how to apply it in a real scenario.

Thirdly, I'm not fluent in English. Please help me to fix this book by
contributing at my [repository](https://github.com/kureikain/simplyrethink). Because of this,
sometime my tone sounds tough, but that isn't my intention.

Forthly, RethinkDB is changing so fast that something in this book may not reflect
to the current state. Bear with it and let me know, via my email or Github. Since this is a LeanPub
book, once I updated you can download it again free of charge.

And finally, due to my limited knowledge with RethinkDB (again, I'm nowhere a
RethinkDB expert), I want to keep this book short and to the point. Expect 60-80
pages. A book that you can pick up and read on the train when riding to work, and after
a week you find yourself start a RethinkDB project.

# Why RethinkDB

RethinkDB is a mind blowing to me. I like the beauty, nature of ReQL which is
built into your language. It's also very developer friendly with its own
administrator UI.
