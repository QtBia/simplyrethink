## Introduction

Welcome the readers. I appreciate your purchase. This will help me continue
improving the book content.

Before we go into the technical detail, I have something to say.

Firsly, I'm not a RethinkDB expert at all. RethinkDB is just so good to pick up.
However, due to its age, it doesn't have many book, document comparing to other
database system. RethinkDB Doc/API document is very good. However, at the entry
level, it can be hard to understand how to use an API. This books try to
organize the concept of RethinkDB, make you able to read and understand
RethinkDB API directly. . 

This book is what I wish I had read when I started with RethinkDB instead of
spedning hours on Google, StackOverflow.

Secondly, I'm a fan of Mixu's[^mixu] writing style[^mixu_write]. I won't cover deeply stuff like installing RethinkDB, and so on. Those topic is covered very good on from RethinkDB document itself. You can easily look up for a particular API and find all its argument, option. I won't cover them all.

Thirdly, I'm not fluent in English. Please help me to fix this book by
contributing at my [repository](https://github.com/kureikain/simplyrethink). Because of this,
sometime my tone sounds tough, but that isn't my intention.

Forthly, RethinkDB is changing so fast so something in this book may not reflect
to the current state. Bear with me and let me know. Since this is a LeanPub
book, once I updated you can download it free of charge.

And finally, due to my limited knowledge with RethinkDB (again, I'm nowhere a
RethinkDB expert), I want to keep this book short and to the point. Expect 60-80
pages.

A book that you can pick up and read on the train when riding to work, and after
a week you find yourself start a RethinkDB project.
