# Introduction

Welcome the readers. Firsly, I'm not a RethinkDB export but RethinkDB is just so good to pick up. I realize that any framework, any language, any tool will not be popular without someone
do something. PHP had it bad day, and Taylor bring it up with Laravel. http://tech.esper.com/2014/07/15/why-we-use-ocaml/


# How the book is write
Secondly, I'm a fan of Mixy writing style http://blog.mixu.net/2012/07/26/writing-about-technical-topics-like-its-2012/. I won't cover deeply stuff like installing RethinkDB, and so on. RethinkDB is indeed, extensively. You can easily look up for a particular API and find all its argument, option. I won't cover them all. I just want to make you have a good foundation with it

# English fluently

Thirdly, I'm not fluent in English. Please help me to fix this book by
contributing at https://github.com/kureikain/simplyrethink Because of this,
sometime my tone sound toughs, but that isn't my intention.

Fortly, RethinkDB is changing so fast so something in this book may not reflect
to the current state. Bear with me and let me know. Since this is a LeanPub
book, once I updated you can download it free of charge.

And finally, due to my limited knowledge with RethinkDB (again, I'm nowhere a
RethinkDB expert), I want to keep this book short and to the point. Expect 60-80
pages.
